# Campus-Placement-and-Job-Portal
The project aims to develop a web-based platform for campus placements, allowing students to register, create profiles, and apply for jobs. Recruiters can post openings, shortlist candidates, and manage hiring. Admins can track placement stats through dashboards, making the process digital, efficient, and transparent.
